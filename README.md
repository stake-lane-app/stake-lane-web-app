## Match Card States

The application displays matches in three distinct states:

   - Up/down arrows for score prediction
   - Match date and time
   - League indicator

2. **Live** (During Match)
   - Current score display
   - Live minute indicator (e.g., "32'")
   - Real-time updates
   - Current prediction status

3. **Finished** (After Match End)
   - Final score
   - Points earned display
   - Color-coded feedback:
     - 🟢 Green: Correct prediction
     - 🟡 Yellow: Partially correct (correct result, wrong score)
     - ⚪ Gray: Incorrect prediction

## Points System

Users earn points based on prediction accuracy:
- **Exact Score**: Maximum points (e.g., 20 pts)
- **Correct Result**: Partial points (e.g., 14 pts)
- **Incorrect**: No points (0 pts)

The points are displayed on finished match cards with color-coded badges.
